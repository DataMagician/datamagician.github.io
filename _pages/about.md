I like to find and solve business "problems" using clear communication,
technology, process improvement, automation, and quantative measurement.

Software / Infrastructure Architect - Interested in technologies that improve
the entire software development/delivery lifecycle. Extensive experience with
Application Lifecycle Management.  Extensive training/mentoring background - I
would generally rather teach myself out of a job as a consultant. Passionate
public speaker - user groups, technical training, conferences.

I'm also a photographer, musician, billiards enthusast, and gamer (nearly all
racing) 

# Highlights

* Learning focused, highly motivated professional - I don't just enjoy this
  stuff 9-5. Working to improve something that already exists in many ways seems
  better than creating things new

* Crusher of technical debt. Building more debt on top of more debt tends to get
  quite expensive over the long term rather than correcting the core issues that
  led to said debt.
  
* Extensive Database Experience
  * Administration
  * Development
  * Performance Tuning
  * Data Warehousing
  * Cube Design
  * Reporting and Data Visualization
  
* Extensive security experience
  * Secure software development practices and code auditing
  * Secure infrastructure setup, management, reporting, and remediation
  
  
# Background

## In the beginning...

I started out work in the mid 90's at a local dial-up Internet Service Provider
providing technical support, eventually working my way to webmaster.  Having
access to a T-1 in 1995 is an amazing thing (especially in those days).  I
believe this and another ISP job gave me a serious foundation in networking and
a deep understanding of networking, routing, and the telephone system

## Moving to Training
The next step in my career actually turned me from a student in an MCSE series
to being a trainer in that very same class. As a student, I asked many difficult
questions, and ultimately was asked if I would consider becoming a trainer by my
3rd class. Because of my ISP background, my first teach was the Microsoft TCP/IP
course (688) to the same group of students I was sitting through the first 4
classes with.

Ultimately, I signed a 3 year contract, and began living in hotels more than my
own house, continuiously taking Microsoft exams in order to be eligable to teach
the courses I was asked.

Areas I specialized in include:

- Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 Charter MCSE (first 1000)
- SQL Server - 6.5, 7.0, 2000, and on
- .Net Development (Mostly C#, some VB) beginning at .Net 1.0
  
When my contract was complete, I continued to be an independent contract MCT for
several years before I moved to Madison.  I was teaching at Inacom so much that
they decided to move me to Madison and hire me as a full time employee.

## Coming to Madison - Inacom 
I did much more than just training at Inacom.  I worked as a consultant, mentor,
and eventually managed a team of engineers in their Security Practice.  Inacom
was a great company.

A few highlights

* Implented Microsoft CRM 1.0 (First Partner to do so)
  * Co-authored a course on Microsoft CRM 1.2 Customization
  * Extensively customized the CRM application to integrate with other internal
    systems
* Built my first mobile application (running on Windows Mobile) - for mobile
  time tracking for our consultant base.  This was in the early days of
  smartphones (and was eventually rewritten for the .Net compact framework)
* Implemented my first Data Warehouse and Cube using SQL Server 2000, DTS, and some
  custom visualization components hosted on top of Sharepoint 2003
* Rebuilt the Intranet on Sharepoint 2003 and created several web parts and
  extensions to support the business
* Extensive work with the first version of SQL Server Reporting Services (this
  was a core piece of the CRM integration).
* Performed Security Assements and Remediation leading a team of 3 engineers.
  I'll never forget printing out a test page, on a check printer at a casino -
  from the kiosk the servers used.
  
Ultimately, when I did leave Inacom, they were going through the process of a
sale and my department was merged into another - thus eliminating my position.
They did however provide severance of 2 weeks of contract training per month -
for a year. Their HR representative actually helped me create my first LLC.

## Document Management and Solution Integration
I worked as an independent consultant for several years, and then moved to
Naviant. I worked on the document management system Hyland Onbase - and was
certified as a developer.  I also worked with Brainware extensively as a
developer and consultant and became certified there too.

I will always have a fondness in my heart for the private offices, incredible
co-workers, and business problems solved during that time period.

## Moving to SVA and the world of finance
Eventually, after extensive recruiting, I moved from Naviant to SVA Consulting
as an Enterprise Architect.  It was back to being a consultant - and I had to
remember to keep a jacket with me at all times (in case we needed to visit a
customer) - but a very major change in the level of formality.

I spent quite a bit of time working on fighting various customer fires, on
everything from old versions of Sharepoint to building several data warehouses
and BI solutions from data source discovery to visualization and exploration in
various BI tools.

I also learned to do software customizations for a new ERP system named
Acumatica (and became a certified developer) at SVA.  I attended their first
developer conference in Seattle (they flew most of their core developer team
from Russia) and eventually passed their exams
