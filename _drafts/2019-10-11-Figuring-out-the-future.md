I am currently at a bit of a crossroads now in my life. A huge amount changed in
June, and then again just recently. Part of this is an excercise in just getting
my thoughts on paper.

*TL;DR*: Smashed foot, in wheelchair, recently fired, and figuring out the
next steps.  If this doesn't interest you - no worries.

# A routine bicycle ride

In June, I was on a simple bicycle ride near my apartment. It was a beautiful
summer day, and everything seemed to be going really well... Then something
unexpected and life changing happened. 

## A simple bicycle accident

I was riding up one of the streets near my apartment when my front tire started
to get stuck between the pavement and the curb. At that point, I was forced to
decide between two options to unstick the tire:

  1. Swerve left towards traffic, possibly getting hit by a car... or...
  2. Swerve right, jump the curb, regain balance on the sidewalk, and continue
     the ride.

I chose the second option. I had done this plenty of times on my own bicycle,
and didn't think that much could happen...  boy was I wrong. I was able to hop
the bike up the curb, and onto the sidewalk. The problem was putting my right
foot down to regain balance.

I believe it was a combination of bad footing, as well as a bunch of extra
weight on an unfamiliar bike. Either way, the bike rolled over my foot,
ankle, and leg. This caused a much more severe injury than I realized at
the time.

In shock, and thinking I may have simply twisted my ankle, all I could think
about was getting back home again. Somehow, I rode the bike back to the station
I checked it out from, and limped (very slowly) the few blocks back to my apartment.

## Realizing how badly I was hurt

Once I made it home, I realized that the injury was much more severe than I had
thought at first. It took a while for me to process this and for the shock to
reside.  Unfortunately, by that time, urgent care had closed and I didn't want
to go for an emergency room visit.

The next morning, I was taken into urgent care by two amazing friends to have
x-rays done. The results were much worse than I imagined. I had broken most of
the metatarsal bones in my foot (the middle ones), fractured my tibia, and even
did some damage up the leg from the twisting motion to my leg. I was going to
have to have a surgery scheduled to rebuild my foot. I went home from urgent
care in a splint, with an appointment scheduled to meet with an orthapedic
surgeon. 

## Foot Surgery (#1)

After my first appointment, surgery was scheduled for July 5th. They were going
to reconstruct my foot, and I should be able to walk again.  While I had no idea
what I was in for at that point, at least I had an actual cast instead of
the splint I went home from urgent care with. I was in quite a bit of pain
leading up to the surgery, but I truly had no true concept of pain just yet in
retrospect. 

Until my last pre-op appointment, I thought that it would be an outpatient
surgery. I was informed at the last appointment that it would be in-patient, and
that I would be spending at least one night in the hospital.

The surgery was the most painful thing I've experienced thus far in my life.
Because the amount of work on my foot was so extensive, they put a nerve block
in from my knee down for the surgery. It took quite a while in the operating
room, but somehow my talented surgeon managed to screw my shattered right foot
back into place (as well as my tibia and fibula).

Unfortunately, the cast they put on after the surgery was too tight for the
amount of swelling my foot, ankle, and leg were prepared to do. After the first
night of agony, they cut the cast along each side, which eased the pressure due
to swelling.  Unfortunately, this meant that I was going to have to spend
another night in the hospital so they could appropriately manage the pain.

I didn't know there were windowless hospital rooms, but after staying in one for
2 nights, I really don't recommend it.

## Returning home (and doing a little work)

After 2 of the longest nights of my life,  I was finally released. I had a
friend pick me up from the hospital and give me a ride back to my apartment. At
first I refused a wheelchair, but soon realized it would absolutely be needed.

I had bruised several ribs, so crutches weren't working well for me at all.  The
hospital suggested a wheelchair, but I stupidly refused and took home a walker.

I did do some work from home, but one important policy I've set for myself is
that I won't write code or make important decisions while on any form of opiate,
thus I wasn't always available or able to develop software when the pain was
severe. 

## Learning to get around

The walker was difficult, even around my tiny apartment, but it hurt a lot less
than using crutches. I only once left the house with the walker, and that was to
go to my first day back at the office. I already knew that I would need a
wheelchair, given the size of the space I worked in.  Luckily I only had to go
one day with the walker before a wheelchair was delivered.

There are quite a few things that one doesn't likely think of when breaking
their right foot at first.  A major one is driving - which was completely
impossible as I could put no pressure whatsoever on the foot. It was also in a
very large cast (For the record, I had two blue casts, one green cast, and one
bright pink cast before they put me into a boot in case anyone was wondering).

## Transportation and returning to the office

For transportation, I relied on either an incredible coworker (you know who you
are) that would pick me up in the morning and drop me off after work. On the days
that wasn't possible, Uber was my only real choice for transportation to and
from work (and nearly anywhere else I needed to go)

As much as remote work might have been nice, there was too much inter-team
interaction and face to face communication needed to ensure the project I was
working on was successful. Thus, I became the guy in the wheelchair zooming
around to various parts of the office. The smart people and interesting
challenges I worked on were incredible.

## Wheelchair Life

Lots of things are quite a bit more difficult in a wheelchair:

* Navigating the apartment (especially at first)
* Living most of your day in a fairly uncomfortable chair
* Carrying...  well, nearly anything.
* Shopping (see the carrying part)
* Getting back and forth to anywhere (the driver has to fold the wheelchair and
  put it into the trunk of the car, and get it out each time)
* Preparing food (I couldn't do much cooking before anyway) - and delivery
  charges. 
  
Wheelies were one thing I can think of that are quite fun to master in a
wheelchair though.  I was making it to the office nearly every day for several
months and working quite a bit more than 40 hours a week... Until two surprise
days at the end of September.
  
# Surprise!

I was scheduled for another surgery on a Thursday, and then fired on a Tuesday
morning via email.

## Foot Surgery (#2) Scheduled

The first surprise happened when I was visiting my orthapedic surgeon for
what I hoped was a final post-op exam. It was routine for the most part until
the x-rays were examined, and he pointed out 3 screws that would be the most
likely to break and could be removed.  This meant another surgery.

Suffice to say that free time - for the surgery, recovery, and physical therapy was
getting even shorter than I had expected. Because the surgeon tested the
flexibility of my foot in each direction, I was in a bit of pain and went home
to work for the rest of the day.

## Surprise - You're Fired!

The following Tuesday, I found email in my personal inbox from HR.  This was
followed up shortly later with a text ensuring I wouldn't be coming to the
office that day. The details aren't something I can publically talk about, as
it's prevented per our agreement. 


# Moving on from here

I'm an incredibly talented software engineer (and other things) that has
valuable skills acquired from a 20+ year background, as well as the rapid
learning I experienced at my last employer. I was able to work with many
incredibly smart people across diverse teams and sets of technology.

Being physically disabled with an upcoming surgery and a good amount of physical
therapy ahead doesn't exactly make me an attractive candidate for a traditional
engineering position at most companies. Nearly all of the recruiters and other
employers I've spoken with don't see me as a viable candidate until January when
I can walk again.

While at first this was discouraging, I realized that there are also quite a few
advantages to my current situation - as I can support myself at least through
the surgery and recovery period

## Keeping my skills up to date

Software is an interesting thing. Keeping one's skills on the bleeding edge
(say, .Net Core) when you're not able to use it in your work is a difficult
thing, especially when focusing heavily on work projects.

I'm glad to have quite a few resources, and things I've been meaning to learn in
greater depth. There are so many resources (both free and paid) that I find
incredibly useful in continuious learning.

### Software Engineering and Operations

There's always good content to find for free on [channel9 (msdn)][channel9] for
nearly anything Microsoft. 

I'm also an [Apple Developer][appledev] (or at least someone with a
subscription) that comes with many learning resources.

Finally, I subscribe to [PluralSight][psight] for the incredibly [large content
library][pscourses].  I also subscribe to another more specialized training
company called [PragmaticWorks][pragw]

[pragw]: https://www.pragmaticworks.com/

### Security Conference Videos

There are always a good amount of security conference videos in my backlog.  I
follow the CCC Congress Presentations, as well as Defcon (and some BlackHat
videos).  These can be a nice break from more "formal" learning for me.

## Working on side projects

There have been many side projects (and even gadgets I've picked up) that I have
yet to fully play with and utilize:

* [A CrowPi][crowpi]: A raspberry pi - but packaged with many sensors in a very
  well constructed case with many accessories.
  
* Continuing to build out my home lab - I have quite a few pieces of hardware
  for a single person living in a 1 bedroom apartment. I also really enjoy
  keeping an eye on the traffic that enters and leaves my network from the many
  devices it contains.
  
* Continuing to work on a comfortable Linux workstation build (likely arch).  I
  currently use several Macs, and a laptop running Qubes-OS for day to day work,
  but there are a few other devices, from switches and access points, to my
  pi-hole, to the OpenBSD router that helps me to control my traffic, and
  SecurityOnion to examine things at a deeper level.
  
* Learning new security tools and capabilities

## Finding a good work fit.

I'm going to ensure that my next job (as an employee, or consultant) is a good
fit for me, my style of work, and my lifestyle.

* Dev/Sec/CloudOps - an area I see a growing need for and that many of my
  previous skills match well with.
  
* Software Engineering and Architecture - not just churning out code, but
  looking at the entire ALM cycle - from tasks and source control, to
  continuious integration, packaging, deployment, and scaling of software, both
  on-premise, in the cloud, or a hybrid model.
  
* Security Researcher - An area that I've spent plenty of time doing as a hobby,
  but would really love to find a place where I can surround myself with smarter
  people than myself and get paid to "break stuff".  Presenting at Defcon or
  another security conference is a huge goal of mine - not just to attend.
  
## Finally, keeping balanced

* Continuing to learn the guitar

* Getting back to photography - I haven't taken nearly enough pictures in too
  long... 
  
* Playing a few video games (maybe)

* Finding new friends and reaching out to existing ones - surrounding myself
  with positive people that I like and respect is crucial.
  
# Now - the few questions I have...

* What other or different things might you do in my shoes?

* Do any wheelchair users have suggestions for getting out without spending a
  fortune on Uber?
  
* How might you change this "first post" - and why?
