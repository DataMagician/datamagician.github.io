This will likely become a continued piece - where I curate some of the more
interesting articles and links that I come across.

* (8 days ago) - [My Time At Snap][timeatsnap] ([HN Discussion][timeatsnap-hn])
  was a long and interesting read.
  
* 40 years since one of my favorite books was published - [The Hitchhikers Guide
  to the Galaxy][hhgtg-art] - and nature had a decent article about it.
  Discussion on [HN][hhgtg-art-hn] seemed to be a bit mixed.
